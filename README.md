# Js Parser

This is an experimental js parser for self-learning, and the learning template comes from `acorn`.

## Step1

Completely implemented in `js`, the main goal of this stage is to learn.

## Step2

Use `rust` to rewrite to ensure that the package size is as small as possible and the speed is as fast as possible.
